The invisible world of data signals (Hertzian space), and its inverse,‘analogue space’, are the focus of Natasha’s research. Do we need analogue communication spaces to thrive in the digital world, and to fully understand it? How can we visualise Hertzian space? Can a critical approach to the presence and absence of data form new approaches to civic engagement, democracy, and new types of space?</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div>\n        <div>\n          <div><p><b>Pete Quinn Davis</b></p></div>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <p>Pete has been focusing on how we can use scanned data to physically manifest, manage, direct and utilize the unique potentialities of scanning technology.
