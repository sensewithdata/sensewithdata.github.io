"Based on decades of empirical research and practical application, this talk presents ways to optimize team collaboration and provides a model to improve sense-making and wayfinding for team members and team leaders. The outcomes-based model provides a way for teams to think about collaboration that will improve team productivity, quality, consensus, and satisfaction."
