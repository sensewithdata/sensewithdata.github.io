"In this thesis I argue for consideration of a precursive level of sensemaking that influences how individuals think about and respond to organisational change. In asking ‘how’ knowledgeable agents understand an altered environment, I adopt a holistic view of organisational and cognitive sensemaking literatures, to produce a sensemaking template identifying four key relational influences: equilibration, intentionality, temporal context, and knowledge structures."
