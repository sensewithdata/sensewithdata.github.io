"In this paper, we challenge the universality of three basic assumptions prevalent in organizational decision support and strategy: assumptions of order, of rational choice, and of intent. We describe the Cynefin framework, a sense making device we have developed to help people make sense of the complexities made visible by the relaxation of these assumptions."
